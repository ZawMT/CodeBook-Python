# CodeBook-Python
## About this repo
This repo is created to be useful or readable like a book on programming, here it is Python. However, the contents are created while I am working on or learning the items as per the requirements. So it is not organized like a book that we usually see in the market. Chapters will not be orgainzied in any particular order and the technical content might be scattered randomly. However, I hope, it can turn out to be the charm of this book. In fact, the original purpose is to note down or record the knowledge that I, like all other programmers, happen to come across so it will last relatively longer. 

Will it be really informative or readable like a normal programming book?
I am not so sure. I am just trying something which might have already tried by a million others. Time will tell. Anyway, I will try my best to make it useful and to make the time spent on reading it worthwhile. What can I do to achieve those? I will make sure that the codes will be as readable as possible. In any location suitable, the comments will be written in the purposing of putting some extra light to the subject. Cross-referencing will be made too. 

I hope this can serve as a book-alive to all the readers.

## Convention
In a project, general informative comments will be added like CodeBookNote#Number. Therefore, to know about a project look for CodeBookNote#0 in the particular project. If a comment is written in a place which can be easily overlooked, this tag will be added to the comment so it will not be missed out CodeBookNote#. All the comments will be informative here in this CodeBook.

I tested the codes using sublime text editor.

Problems:
1: TypeError: Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable

Solutions:
1:
	Serializing a decimal number to a json object will cause this error. 
	The solution is to use string instead of a decimal.
	So in the case of db query of which the result will be automatically serialized to a json object:
	
	Example:
	In the following codes, 
	'cols' is the list of the column, and 'dhnd.query_data' is a library which will query the data and return the json result.
	
	cols=['transactiontime', 'name', 'amount_usd'] 
    recTran = dhnd.query_data(tableName, cols, ['transaction_id'], [transactionID])
	
	When amount_usd is a decimal number, then this will cause the error.
	
	The solution is:
	To use the facility of DB to cast the decimal value to string.
	In the above example, the DB is MySQL and the decimal value can be casted to stirng as follows:
	cast(amount_usd as char) as amount_usd
	
	So changing cols=['transactiontime', 'name', 'amount_usd'] to cols=['transactiontime', 'name', 'cast(amount_usd as char) as amount_usd'] will resolve the issue. 
	But the solution differs from one DB to another.
